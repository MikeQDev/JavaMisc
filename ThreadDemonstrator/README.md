ThreadDemonstrator
================
The user provides a number to count to and the amount of threads to be used in order to demonstrate the power of threads (concurrent computing.)

Each time a thread adds a number, the thread name and the number it produced is output and that specific thread is 'put to sleep' for 50ms. (The sleep time allows demonstration of how a program can alternate between threads in real-world applications.)
